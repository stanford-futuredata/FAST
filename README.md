# FAST tutorial

### Dependencies
The pipeline is implemented in Python and C++, with the following dependencies:
```
c++ dependency: boost
python dependencies: obspy, pywt, scipy, numpy, skimage, sklearn
```

### Install
Copy the zip file to your home diretory, unzip and install the Python dependencies:
```sh
~/$ unzip quake-tutorial.zip
~/$ cd quake-tutorial
~/quake-tutorial$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Install the C++ dependencies:
```sh
~/quake-tutorial$ sudo apt-get install cmake, build-essential, libboost-all-dev 
```


### Dataset

Raw SAC files for each station are stored under  ```data/waveforms${STATION}```. Station "HEC" has 3 components so it should have 3 time series data files; the other stations have only 1 component.



### Fingerprint
Parameters for each station is under ```parameters/fingerprint/```. To fingerprint all stations and generate the global index, you can call the wrapper script:
```sh
~/quake-tutorial$ python run_fp.py -c config.json
```
The fingerprinting step takes less than 1 minute per waveform file on a 2.60GHz CPU. The generated fingerprints can be found at ```data/waveforms${STATION}/fingerprints/${STATION}${CHANNEL}.fp```. The json file ```data/waveforms${STATION}/${STATION}_${CHANNEL}.json``` contains information about the fingerprint file, including number of fingerprints (`nfp`) and dimension of each fingerprint (`ndim`).

Alternatively, to fingerprint a specific stations, call the fingerprint script with the corresponding fingerprint parameter file:
```sh
~/quake-tutorial$ cd fingerprint/
~/quake-tutorial/fingerprint$ python gen_fp.py ../parameters/fingerprint/fp_input_CI_CDY_EHZ.json
```

In addition to generating fingerprints, the wrapper script calls the global index generation script automatically. The global index (as opposed to index with a single component) is a consistent way to refer to fingerprint times at different components and stations. Global index generation should only be performed after you've generated fingerprints for *every* component and station that is used in the detection: 
```sh
~/quake-tutorial/fingerprint$ python global_index.py  ../parameters/fingerprint/global_indices.json
```
The resulting global index mapping for each component is stored at ```data/global_indices/${STATION}_${CHANNEL}_idx_mapping.txt```, where line `i` in the file represents the global index for fingerprint `i-1` in this component.

### Similarity Search
Compile and build the code for similarity search:
```sh
~/quake-tutorial$ cd simsearch
~/quake-tutorial/simsearch$ cmake .
~/quake-tutorial/simsearch$ make
```

Call the wrapper script to run similarity search for all stations:
```sh
~/quake-tutorial/simsearch$ cd ..
~/quake-tutorial$ python run_simsearch.py -c config.json
```

Alternatively, to run the similarity search for each station individually, copy the config file to the current directory, and uncomment corresponding blocks of parameters:
```sh
~/quake-tutorial$ cd simsearch
~/quake-tutorial/simsearch$ cp ../parameters/simsearch/simsearch_input_HectorMine.sh  .
~/quake-tutorial/simsearch$ ./simsearch_input_HectorMine.sh
```

### Postprocessing
Copy the helper scripts for postprocessing into the folder:
```sh
~/quake-tutorial/simsearch$ cd ../postprocessing
~/quake-tutorial/postprocessing$ cp ../parameters/postprocess/*  .
```
The following scripts parse the binary output from similarity search to text files, and combine the three channel results for Station HEC to a single output. Finally, it copies the parsed outputs to directory ```../data/input_network/```.
```sh
~/quake-tutorial/postprocessing$ ./output_HectorMine_pairs.sh
~/quake-tutorial/postprocessing$ ./combine_HectorMine_pairs.sh
```

Run network detection:
```sh
~/quake-tutorial/postprocessing$ python scr_run_network_det.py 7sta_2stathresh_network_params.json
```
Results from the network detection are under ```data/network_detection/7sta_2stathresh_network_detlist*```. The file contains a list of potential detections including information about starting fingerprint index (global index, or time) at each station, number of stations where we found other events similar to this event (`nsta`), total number of similar fingerprint pairs mapped to the event (`tot_ndets`), total sum of the similarity values (`tot_vol`). Detailed format of the output can be found in the user guide. 

Optionally, to clean up the results from network detection:
```sh
~/quake-tutorial/postprocessing$ cp ../utils/network/* .
~/quake-tutorial/postprocessing$ python arrange_network_detection_results.py
~/quake-tutorial/postprocessing$ ./remove_duplicates_after_network.sh
~/quake-tutorial/postprocessing$ python delete_overlap_network_detections.py
~/quake-tutorial/postprocessing$ ./final_network_sort_nsta_peaksum.sh

```
The results from the above scripts can be found at ```data/network_detection/7sta_2stathresh_FinalUniqueNetworkDetectionTimes.txt```

### Plotting
To plot the waveforms from network detection:
```sh
~/quake-tutorial/postprocessing$ cd ../utils/events 
~/quake-tutorial/utils/events$ python PARTIALplot_hector_detected_waveforms.py 0 50
```
The above script plots the first 50 waveforms from the output. You can view the images at data/network_detection/7sta_2stathresh_NetworkWaveformPlots/
